# AgendaGeneratorPHP

## Purpose
For use by Loop1 Sales Engineers to build an HTML agenda for services projects

## Usage
- Fill out the form with the modules and days scoped for the agenda, choose an engagement type (or just server specs) and submit.
- CTRL-A copy the entire page it generates and paste it into the Word Agenda template we use already
 
## Dependencies
Requires PHP and some kind of web hosting to run this (I just used XAMPP when coding this locally)

## Installation
Clone the repository, point Apache or other web hosting to the index.php file
